# hello-bash
To create the above script, run the following set of instructions in your terminal:

1. In the directory of your choosing, run `nano hello-world.sh`
2. The first line should be a shebang with the path to your bash shell, in my case, it'll look like this: `#!/bin/bash`
3. In the second line, write the line `echo "Hello world"`
4. Press `CTRL + O` then `ENTER` to save the file
5. Press `CTRL + X` to exit after saving
6. Back in the terminal, change the mode to give the file execution permission by typing `chmod +x hello-world.sh`
7. To run your script, type `./hello-world.sh`
